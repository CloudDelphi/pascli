@title(Overview)
@shorttitle(pascli)

pascli is a library written for Free Pascal and aims to provide components that allow the rapid creation of command line applications.

It uses a Builder to allow the description of arguments, commands and options, performs the automatic validation of these parameters and also displays the appropriate syntax for using the application to the user.

This strategy allows the developer to focus on the implementation of commands and create an application with a simple code structure.
