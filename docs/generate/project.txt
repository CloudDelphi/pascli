This project was developed using @html(<a href="https://www.lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus 2.2.2</a>) and @html(<a href="https://www.freepascal.org/">FPC 3.2.2</a>). It may work on older versions, but it's not our team's target.

The project is also configured to work with vscode. It has configuration for build, tests and debug. However, some extensions detailed in the dependencies section below may be required.
