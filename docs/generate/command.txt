@title(Command structure)
@shorttitle(Command structure)

The library's command structure consists of the application, commands, options, and arguments. The user will need to follow the following structure when typing some command in the terminal:

@longCode(
  appexe [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
)

@section(1 SecFirst Application)

The application will be the name of the executable generated after the project is compiled. Through this name the user can choose which command to execute. The application can accept commands or arguments, but it cannot accept options because there is no configuration provided for this scenario.

@section(1 SecSecond Command)

Name of the command associated with the action to be performed. The list of possible commands can be obtained through a specific command or it can be set as default. As long as the application has been configured to do so. The command name cannot have spaces or start with special characters. A command can accept options when configured.

@section(1 SecThird Options)

Options are associated with the command and allow the user to change the behavior of the command while it is running. Options must be passed as an argument using one "-" for their short form and two "--" for their long form.

@section(1 SecFourth Arguments)

Arguments are parameters passed via the command line that are not a previously known value, that is, they cannot be configured within criteria that can be validated. For example: a name to be used as a project name for a build command, a file name, a number, etc. It is up to the developer to provide the validation of these arguments.
